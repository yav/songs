Intro
Em Bm G7 F#7 Bm

If you want a [Em]lover
I'll do anything you [D]ask me to
And if you want a[Em]nother kind of love
I'll wear a [D]mask for you
If you want a [Bm]partner, take my hand, or
If you want to [G]strike me down in anger [A]
Here I stand
I'm your [Bm]man

If you want a [Em]boxer
I will step into the [D]ring for you
And if you want a [Em]doctor
I'll examine every [D]inch of you
If you want a [Bm]driver, climb inside
Or if you want to [G]take me for a ride
You [A]know you can
I'm your [Bm]man

Ah, the [D]moon's too bright
The [G]chain's too tight
The [A]beast won't go to [D]sleep
I've been [F#m]running through these promises to you
That I [Bm]made and I could not keep
Ah, but a [F#]man never got a woman back
Not by [Bm]begging on his knees
Or I'd [G]crawl to you baby and I'd [F#]fall at your feet
And I'd [G]howl at your beauty like a [F#]dog in heat
And I'd [G]claw at your heart, and I'd [E]tear at your sheet
I'd say [A]please (please)
I'm your [Bm]man

And if you've got to [Em]sleep a moment on the road
I will [D]steer for you
And if you want to [Em]work the street alone
I'll dis[D]appear for you
If you want a [Bm]father for your child
Or only want to [G]walk with me a while across the [A]sand
I'm your [Bm]man
