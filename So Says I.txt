So Says I
by The Shins

intro: [D] walk down C, A, G

[Am] An add[D]ress to the golden door,
[Am]I was [D]strumming on a stone a-
[Am]gain, pulling [D]teeth from the pimps of go-
[E]re when hatched, a tragic opera in

[Am]my mind. And it       [D]told of a new de-
[Am]sign,  in which       [D]every soul is duty
[Am]bound,          to up [D]hold all the statutes of
[E]boredom. Therein lies, the fatal flaw of the

[C]red age. 'Cause it was   [F]nothing like we'd ever
[C]dreamt, our lust for     [F]life had gone away with the
[C]rent we hated, 'cause it [D]made no money, no-
[F]body saved no one's      [G]life this time.

[Am]            So we [D]burned all our uni-
[Am]forms,    and let [D]nature take its course a-
[Am]gain,     and the [D]big ones just eat all the
[E]little ones. i        That sends us back to the

[Am]drawing board... [D]

In our
[C]darkest hours, we have all
[G]asked for some, angel to
[F]come, sprinkle his
[C]dust all a[G]round.  But

[C]all our crying voices they can't
[G]turn it around And you've had some
[F]crazy conversations of your
[Am]own... [D]  [Am]

[E] [D] walk down C, A, G

[Am]               We've got [D]rules and maps and
[Am]guns in our backs but we [D]still can't just be-
[Am]have ourselves           [D]even if to save our own
[E]lives so says I,             we are a brutal

[Am]kind... [D]

[C]          'Cause this is     [F]nothing like we'd ever
[C] dreamt. Tell Sir Thomas     [F]More we've got another
[C]failed attempt. 'Cause if it [D]makes them money, they
[F]might just give you          [G]life this time.
