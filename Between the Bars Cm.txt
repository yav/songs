(Original starts on Gm)

[Cm]Drink up, baby, [Ab]stay up all night
With the [Eb]things you could do, you [G7]won't but you might
The po[Cm]tential you'll be that [Ab]you'll never see
The [Eb]promises [G7]you'll only [Ab]make

Drink [Cm]up with me now and for[Ab]get all about
The [Eb]pressure of days, [G7]do what I say
And I'll [Cm]make you okay and [Ab]drive them away
The [Eb]images [G7]stuck in your [Ab]head

[Ab]Peo[G7]ple [Cm]you've been [Eb]before that you
[Ab]Don't [G7]want a[Cm]round [Eb]anymore
That [Ab]push and [Bb]shove and won't [Cm]bend to your [Eb]will
[Ab]I'll keep them [Abm]still

[Cm]Drink up, baby, [Ab]look at the stars
I'll [Eb]kiss you again, [G7]between the bars
Where I'm [Cm]seeing you there, with your [Ab]hands in the air
[Eb]Waiting to [G7]finally be [Ab]caught

Drink [Cm]up one more time and [Ab]I'll make you mine
[Eb]Keep you apart, [G7]deep in my heart
Sepa[Cm]rate from the rest, where [Ab]I like you the best
And [Eb]keep the [G7]things you for[Ab]got

[Ab]Peo[G7]ple [Cm]you've been [Eb]before that you
[Ab]Don't [G7]want a[Cm]round [Eb]anymore
That [Ab]push and [Bb]shove and won't [Cm]bend to your [Eb]will
[Ab]I'll keep them [Abm]still
