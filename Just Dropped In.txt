Just Dropped In
by Kenny Rogers
(Original starts on D)

I [Bm]woke up this morning with the [E]sundown shining [Bm]in
I [Bm]found my mind in a [D]brown paper bag [F#]within
I [Bm]tripped on a cloud and [D]fell-a eight miles high
I [E]tore my mind on a [G]jagged sky
I [Bm]just dropped in to [F#]see what condition my con[Bm]dition was in

[Bm]Yeah, [A]yeah, oh-[D]yeah, what con- [E]dition my con[Bm]dition was in

[A] [F] [G]

I [Cm]pushed my soul in a [F]deep dark hole and then I [Cm]followed it in
I [Cm]watched myself crawling [Eb]out as I was a-crawling [G]in
I [Cm]got up so tight I [Eb]couldn't unwind
I [F]saw so much I [Ab]broke my mind
I [Cm]just dropped in to [G]see what condition my con[Cm]dition was in

[Cm]Yeah, [Bb]yeah, oh-[Eb]yeah, what con[F]dition my con[Cm]dition was in

[Bb] [F#] [G#]

Some[C#m]one painted April [F#]Fool in big black letters on a [C#m]Dead End sign
I had my [C#m]foot on the gas as I [E]left the road and blew [G#]out my mind
Eight [C#m]miles outta Memphis and I [E]got no spare
Eight [F#]miles straight up down[A]town somewhere
I [C#m]just dropped in to [G#]see what condition my con[C#m]dition was in

I said
I [C#m]just dropped in to [G#]see what condition my con[C#m]dition was in

[C#m]Yeah [B]yeah [C#m]oh-yeah
