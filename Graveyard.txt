I wanna tell you a story
Ain't got no characters in it but me
I wanna sing you a sad song
Most of it I don't expect you to believe
It starts off just the Whiskey and Wine
Miles of travel and some real good times
But it ends in a dark corridor
Where there ain't no windows
And there ain't no doors

Well that's me
Just a'drinkin' off this bottle
And a'driftin' out to sea
Well that's me
Just a'sittin here starin'
And a'shakin' like a leaf
Well that's me
Just a'leanin' on my shovel
In this graveyard of dreams
Yeah that's me
Just a'leanin' on my shovel
In this graveyard of dreams

I wanna take you to a shipwreck
A thousand miles underneath the black sea
It looks like everybody's sleeping
But look close they are dead indeed
I wanna lead you to an armchair
Deep black in the files of my mind
I wanna sit you in the candle's light
Where I've been spendin' all of my time

Well that's me
Just a'drinkin' off this bottle
Is it drinkin' off of me
Now that's me
Just a'sittin' here starin'
And a'shakin' like a leaf
Well that's me
Just a'leanin' on my shovel
In this graveyard of dreams
Yeah that's me
Just a'leanin' on my shovel
In this graveyard of dreams
