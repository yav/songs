American Jesus
by Bad Religion

[Am]I don't need to be a [C]global citizen
[F]Because I'm blessed by natio[G]nality
[Am]I'm member of a [C]growing populace
[F]We enforce our popu[G]larity

[Am]There are things that seem to [C]pull us under
[F]And there are things that [G]drag us down
[Am]But there's a power and a [C]vital presence
That's [F]lurking all a[E]round

[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]See him [C]on the [F]inter[G]state
[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]He helped build the [G]president's [F]estate

[Am]I feel sorry for the [C]earth's population
[F]'Cause so few live in the [G]U.S.A.
[Am]At least the foreigners can [C]copy our morality
[F]They can visit but they [G]cannot stay

[Am]Only precious few can [C]garner the prosperity
[F]It makes us walk with renewed [G]confidence
[Am]We've got a place to [C]go when we die
And the [F]architect resides right [E]here

[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]Foste[C]ring their [F]shame on [G]faith
[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]Overwhelming [G]millions every [F]day

[E]

[Am] He's the farmers' barren fields [C] the force the army wields
[F]  The expression in the faces of the [G]starving millions
The [Am]power of the man he's the [C]fuel that drives the clan
He's the [F]motive and the conscience of the [G]murderer

[Am]He's the preacher on TV, [C]the false sincerity
The form [F]letter that's written by the [G]big computers
The [Am]nuclear bombs and the [C]kids with no moms
And I'm [F]fearful that he's inside [E]me

[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]See him [C]on the [F]inter[G]state
[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]Exer[C]cising his au[F]thori[E]ty

[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]Foste[C]ring their [F]shame on [G]faith
[Am]We've [C]got the A[D]merican [F]Jesus
[Am]Overwhelming [G]millions every [F]day

One nation, under god. One nation, under god.
