Bernadette
by Reina Del Cid
(original in F#)

It was a quarter to [G]four AM
Alone in my [Am]kitchenette
That's where I met [C]Bernadette
And I [Cm]still can see her [G]now

First she kicked on the [G]washing machine
Streaked 'cross my [Am]TV screen
Rustled the [C]magazines
And [Cm]blew my candle [G]out

But how many days [C]passed since then? [Cm]
Since I saw her [Em]silhouette [E7]
Now I want her [C]back again
[Cm]Oh, my Berna[G]dette

It was the strangest of [G]summer dreams
Those nights she spent [Am]haunting me
She touched me 'cross [C]centuries
And I [Cm]never felt [G]alone

But one morning I [G]knew she'd gone
Left the lights and Vic[Am]trola on
And I woke to the [C]saddest song
A [Cm]tune from long [G]ago

Now it feels like I [C]lost a friend [Cm]
And I find myself [Em]wondering  [E7]
Will she haunt my [C]home again?
[Cm]Oh, my Berna[G]dette

And each night when I [C]go to bed [Cm]
I leave one candle [Em]flickering [E7]
She finds her way [C]back again
[Cm]Oh, my Berna[G]dette
