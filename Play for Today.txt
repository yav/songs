[Bm]It's not a             [A]case of doing what's
[Bm]right, it's just the   [A]way I feel that
[Bm]matters.     Tell me   [A]I'm wrong I don't really
[G]care.

[Bm]It's not a             [A]case of share and
[Bm]share alike          I [A]take what I re-
[Bm]quire.    I don't under[A]stand ... You say it's not
[G]fair.

[C#m]You expect me      to [D]act like a lover, con-
[Cm]sider my moves and   de[D]serve the reward, to
[Cm]hold you         in my [D]arms and
[Cm]wait               and [C]wait, and wait for something to

[Bm]happen                 [A]

[Bm]It's not a             [A]case of telling the
[Bm]truth, some lines just [A]fit the situ-
[Bm]ation.  Call me a      [A]liar you would any-
[G]way.

[Bm]It's not a             [A]case of aiming to
[Bm]please you know you're [A]always crying
[Bm]It's just your         [A]part in the
[G]play for today
