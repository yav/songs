Cassiopeia
by Reina del Cid

It's a pretty good view on the moon tonight
As the sun's going down on the satellite
And the earth hangs around, my old friend in the sky
'Cause she knows I'm a poor castaway

I weep to think what I've become
Since I crashed landed down in the calcium
I reached for the stars
but I couldn't choose one
So it's here I am bound to remain

I was looking for Cassiopeia
I was searching for gold in the sky
Through my telescope I hope to see her
If only to wish her goodnight

It's dinner time on the moon again
But the candles won't light without oxygen
So I eat by the glow of the world that I left
And wonder if it's still the same

Now that's not to say I'm alone out here
There are hunters and archers and charioteers
And they're flung through the night
Like I'm flung through the years
I hear them all calling my name

I'm still looking for old Ursa Minor
I've been tracking her prints in the sky
Through my telescope I hope to find her
If only to tell her goodnight

Yes and where'd you go, Cassiopeia?
All I found were your tears in the sky
In my dreams I know I'm gonna meet ya
If only to tell you I tried
