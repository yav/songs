Cassiopeia
by Reina del Cid

It's a [C]pretty good view on the moon tonight
As the [F]sun's going down on the [C]satellite
And the [F]earth hangs around, my old [Em]friend in the [Am]sky
'Cause she [G]knows I'm a poor casta[C]way

I [C]weep to think what I've become
Since I [F]crashed landed down in the [C]calcium
I [F]reached for the stars
but I [Em]couldn't choose [Am]one
So it's [G]here I am bound to [C]remain

I was [F]looking for Cassio[C]peia
I was [F]searching for gold in the [G]sky
Through my [Em]telescope I hope to [Am]see her
If [G]only to wish her good[C]night

It's [C]dinner time on the moon again
But the [F]candles won't light without [C]oxygen
So I [F]eat by the glow of the [Em]world that I [Am]left
And [G]wonder if it's still the [C]same

Now [C]that's not to say I'm alone out here
There are [F]hunters and archers and [C]charioteers
And they're [F]flung through the night
Like I'm [Em]flung through the [Am]years
I [G]hear them all calling my [C]name

I'm still [F]looking for old Ursa [C]Minor
I've been [F]tracking her prints in the [G]sky
Through my [Em]telescope I hope to [Am]find her
If [G]only to tell her [C]goodnight

Yes and [F]where'd you go, [C]Cassiopeia?
All I [F]found were your tears in the [G]sky
In my [Em]dreams I know I'm gonna [Am]meet ya
If [G]only to tell you I [C]tried
