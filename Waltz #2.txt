[F]Singing [D]Kathy's [G]clown
That's the [Dm]man she's married to [Am]now
[B7]That's the girl that he [E7]takes around town

She a[Am]ppears composed So she [C]is, I suppose
[F]Who can [D]really [G]tell?
She [Dm]shows no emotion at [Am]all

[Am]Now she's done, and they're [C]calling someone
[F]Such a [D]familiar [G]name
I'm so [Dm]glad that my memory's [Am]remote
'Cause I'm [B7]doing just fine hour to [E7]hour, note to note

In the [Dm]place where I make no mis[Am]takes
[B7]In the place where I [E7]have what it takes
