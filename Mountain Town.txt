Moutain Town
by "Jon and Roy"

Spent my days in a cold war, fighting with myself
Spent my time like money, counted up my wealth
Saved up all my moments for, situations coming
But I don't know much about nothing, I barely know myself.

And oh the bank that's my head, its filled up to the brim
Its bursting at the seams with, thoughts ideas and dreams
And my thinking adviser, he loses focus easily
He leaves me with a balance due, at least that's how it seems.

Now I don't have a manual, to tell me how to be
And I hardly have a theory, just hypotheses
And since I don't have no gods, to help me with what I see
Then that leaves me here with myself, the work is up to me
