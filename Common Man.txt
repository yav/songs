Common Man
by Reina del Cid
(This version is in D, original is in G)

Did you read it in a [G]magazine
while you were sitting on a [D]plane?
Sometihng about St [G]Augustine,
or the life of Charle[D]magne?
That one king who [C]went in[D]sane.
Oh you for[C]got his [D]name?
But you're a [E]regular sponge,
you just soke it all up
you've always [A]been that way.

Did you see a docu[G]mentary?
Can't keep it to your[D]self?
Now you're an expert in [G]geology,
and life in prison [D]cells.
Oh what a burden to know [G]everything,
but you [D]manage [D/C]it so [Bm]well:
as if there's [E]secret life
behind those doe brown eyes
then we [A]never could tell.

MM[G][D][G][A]

So you skimmed a little [G]Hemingway
in your senior English [D]class.
The specifics sort of [G]slipped away,
but you got enough to be an [D]ass.
Oh you never had to [C]work that [D]hard
to be a [C]C+ [D]star,
so that in [E]15 years,
you can talk fine beers,
what a [A]card you are.

Have your friends all lost the [G]point somehow,
working hard on their [D]degrees?
I mean you're basically a [G]docotor now
because of Web M[D]D.
And when the ivory tower [G]crumbles down
No [D]one would [D/C]be more [Bm]pleased
Cause where it [E]used to stand
would be the common man
and his [A]magazines.

And did you read it in a [G]magazines
[D]mmm
Sometihng about the [G]byzantines
[D]mmm
Can't remember [G]everything
mmmm[D] [D/C] [Bm]

But you're a [E]regular sponge
Such a brilliant one
You've always [A]been that way.

[D]
