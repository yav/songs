Whiskey Before Breakfast

Early one morning 'fore the sun could shine
I was walkin' down the street, not feelin' so fine
I saw two old men with a bottle between' em
And this is the song that I heard them singin'

corus:
Lord preserve us and protect us
We been drinkin' whiskey 'fore breakfast
x2

I stopped by the steps where they were a' sittin'
I couldn't believe how drunk they were gettin'
I said "Old men you been drinkn' long?"
"Long enough to be singin' this song"

chorus

They passed me the bottle, said, "Take a little sip"
And it felt so good, I just couldn't quit
So I took a little more, next thing I knew
There were three of us sittin' there singin' this tune

chorus

One by one everybody in town
Heard our ruckus and they all came down
Pretty soon all the streets were a-ringin'
With the sound of the whole town laughin' and singin'
