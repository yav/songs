The
[Am]guests all stood in silence, they
[F]stare and drink their [Am]wine.
[Am]On the wall the canvas hangs,
[C]frozen there in [G]time.  They
[C]marvel at the [G]beauty, the
[Am]horror and de[F]spair.  At the
[Am]Wake of the Medusa,
[C]no one [Em]shed a [Am]tear.

[C]Sit my friends and [G]listen,
[Am]put your glasses [F]down.
[C]Sit my friends and [G]listen to the
[Am]voices [Em]of the [Am]drowned.

[Am]In the moonlight's ghostly glow, I
[F]waken in a [Am]dream.
[Am]Once more upon that raft I stand
[C]upon a raging [G]sea.
[C]In my ears the [G]moans and screams
[Am] of the dying [F]ring.
[Am]Somewhere in the darkness the
[C]siren [Em]softly [Am]sings

[C]Out there in the [G]waves she stands, and
[Am]smiling there she [F]calls.
[C]As the lightning [G]cracks the sky, the
[Am]wind [Em]begins to [Am]howl.

The
[Am]architects of our doom
[F]around their tables [Am]sit, and
[Am]in their thrones of power condemn
[C]those they've cast a[G]drift.
[C]Echoes down the [G]city street, their
[Am]harpy's laughter [F]rings.
[Am]Waiting for the curtain call,
obi[C]livious [Em]in the [Am]wings.

The
[C]casket is [G]empty
A[Am]bandon ye all [F]hope.  They
[C]ran off with the [G]money, and
[Am]left us [Em]with the [Am]rope
