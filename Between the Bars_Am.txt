Between The Bars
by Elliott Smith

[Am]Drink up, baby, [F]stay up all night
With the [C]things you could do, you [E7]won't but you might
The po[Am]tential you'll be that [F]you'll never see
The [C]promises [E7]you'll only [F]make

Drink [Am]up with me now and for[F]get all about
The [C]pressure of days, [E7]do what I say
And I'll [Am]make you okay and [F]drive them away
The [C]images [E7]stuck in your [F]head

[F]Peo[E7]ple [Am]you've been [C]before that you
[F]Don't [E7]want a[Am]round [C]anymore
That [F]push and [G]shove and won't [Am]bend to your [C]will
[F]I'll keep them [Fm]still

[Am]Drink up, baby, [F]look at the stars
I'll [C]kiss you again, [E7]between the bars
Where I'm [Am]seeing you there, with your [F]hands in the air
[C]Waiting to [E7]finally be [F]caught

Drink [Am]up one more time and [F]I'll make you mine
[C]Keep you apart, [E7]deep in my heart
Sepa[Am]rate from the rest, where [F]I like you the best
And [C]keep the [E7]things you for[F]got

[F]Peo[E7]ple [Am]you've been [C]before that you
[F]Don't [E7]want a[Am]round [C]anymore
That [F]push and [G]shove and won't [Am]bend to your [C]will
[F]I'll keep them [Fm]still
