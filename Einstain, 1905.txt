Lyrics to Einstein, 1905

I've been travelling 
at the speed of light
with all earth's history
in the wake behind

Einstein, 1905
he had it right
time stopped long ago
on this ship of mine

How my mother cried
and my father mourned
the girl I used to be
when I climbed aboard

And oh how it's clear to me now
the fare was more
than I should have ever paid
to leave those shores

But still I left
I climbed aboard
and I won't be round no more
All this time
where does it go? 
Back to you
I suppose

I've been dreaming in 
all greens and blues
the afterimages 
of the world I knew

But Shakespeare way back in the year
Of 1602
reminds me above all else
to myself be true

So I go
I remain
and I won't come round again
All this space
what does it do 
If it won't bring me back to you?

You don't need hyperdrives
to reach the stars
I've known galaxies
in a broken heart

And all my equations and lines
my graphs and charts
can't solve the mystery 
of that endless dark
