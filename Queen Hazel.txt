Queen Hazel
by Reina del Cid

In the [Bb]oldest of the mountains
Where the [Gm]fields of poppies [F]grow
There's a [Bb]maiden there as fickle
As the [Gm]wicked wind that [F]blows

And it's [Eb]there that you can [Bb]find her
But if you're [Eb]lucky then you [F]won't
'Cause it's [Eb]many a fool's lost [Gm]all he knew
At [F#]old Queen [F]Hazel's [Bb]throne

She'll [Bb]set her finest china
Put her [Gm]candies in your [F]dish
And if you [Bb]haven't left by midnight
You'll for[Gm]ever wish you [F]did

They [Eb]say her hair is [Bb]made of sunlight
And her [Eb]eye the purest [F]blue
And [Eb]she'll live on [Gm]forever off the
[F#]thing she [F]stole from [Bb]you

They [Eb]don't know if they [Bb]love her
She [Eb]makes them feel [F]insane
But they [Eb]know they'd go to the [Gm]ends of the earth
In [F#]old Queen [F]Hazel's [Bb]name

They [Eb]don't know if it's [Bb]poison
They've [Eb]never felt this [F]way
But they [Eb]know they'd go to the [Gm]ends of the earth
In [F#]old Queen [F]Hazel's [Bb]name

She's [Bb]set a trap for every man
That's [Gm]deep inside his [F]brain
So that [Bb]one taste of her sugar
Leaves him [Gm]begging for the [F]kane

And he'll do [Eb]anything to [Bb]find it
He will [Eb]suffer any [F]pain
He'll [Eb]chase down any [Gm]dragon
Just to [F#]be Queen [F]Hazel's [Bb]slave

They [Eb]don't know if they [Bb]love her
She [Eb]makes them feel [F]insane
But they [Eb]know they'd go to the [Gm]ends of the earth
In [F#]old Queen [F]Hazel's [Bb]name

They [Eb]don't know if it's [Bb]poison
They've [Eb]never felt this [F]way
But they [Eb]know they'd go to the [Gm]ends of the earth
In [F#]old Queen [F]Hazel's [Bb]name

You can [Eb]fall in love with [Bb]Lucy
You can [Eb]marry [F]Mary Jane
But you'll [Eb]only go to the [Gm]ends of the earth
In [F#]old Queen [F]Hazel's [Bb]name
