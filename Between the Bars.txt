(Original starts on Gm)

[Em]Drink up, baby, [C]stay up all night
With the [G]things you could do, you [B7]won't but you might
The po[Em]tential you'll be that [C]you'll never see
The [G]promises [B7]you'll only [C]make

Drink [Em]up with me now and for[C]get all about
The [G]pressure of days, [B7]do what I say
And I'll [Em]make you okay and [C]drive them away
The [G]images [B7]stuck in your [C]head

[C]Peo[B7]ple [Em]you've been [G]before that you
[C]Don't [B7]want a[Em]round [G]anymore
That [C]push and [D]shove and won't [Em]bend to your [G]will
[C]I'll keep them [Cm]still

[Em]Drink up, baby, [C]look at the stars
I'll [G]kiss you again, [B7]between the bars
Where I'm [Em]seeing you there, with your [C]hands in the air
[G]Waiting to [B7]finally be [C]caught

Drink [Em]up one more time and [C]I'll make you mine
[G]Keep you apart, [B7]deep in my heart
Sepa[Em]rate from the rest, where [C]I like you the best
And [G]keep the [B7]things you for[C]got

[C]Peo[B7]ple [Em]you've been [G]before that you
[C]Don't [B7]want a[Em]round [G]anymore
That [C]push and [D]shove and won't [Em]bend to your [G]will
[C]I'll keep them [Cm]still
