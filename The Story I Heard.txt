Hey you, JoJo
Yeah, I know your name
I thought I saw you
Jump a Utah train
But I could not say

I heard you tried to
Put your hat on a shelf
Married a woman
Went off and loved someone else
It could be as well
I cannot tell

Hey you JoJo
Don't you forget your name
They might try to keep you
From the man you have been
So don't go that way

The story I heard
Is that people are bored
And the measures you take
To wrestle with your lord
All the money you take
All the memories you spill
Will He measure your time?
Will He measure your will?

One of these mornings
Will be the loudest you hear
You'll write your story on firecracker paper
And disappear

The story I heard
Is that people are bored
And the measures you take
Just to wrestle your lord
Are the measures you fake
Whether you're dead or just still
Will He measure your time?
Will He measure your will?

One of these mornings
We'll be home
